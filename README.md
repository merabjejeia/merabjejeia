## About me
My name is Merab Jejeia, since August 2022 I have been studying data analytics.

To deepen my knowledge in analysis, I have completed several online courses, through which I have learned Python, SQL, mathematical statistics, probability theory, product metrics, and frameworks for product development. Through academic projects, I have gained practical experience in conducting statistical tests, using GIT and AIRFLOW, and creating dashboards in Tableau.
